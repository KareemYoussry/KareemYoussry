### Hi there 👋
I hope you like your stay in my profile!
### Firstly, I am Kareem, an electronics and communications engineer fresh graduate.
I consider myself a Linux enthusiast (I have been at peace ever since I migrated to Linux). Currently using Arch Linux with KDE and looking to use VoidLinux with dwm soon.\
As of late January 2024, I have claimed the GitHub education pack, and I'm looking to make as much use of it as possible. I would also like to take this as an oppurtunity to actually use GitHub more actively.

- My interests: \
Computer Networks. \
Cybersecurity. \
Embedded Systems.
