### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I hope you like your stay in my profile!
# Firstly, I am Kareem, an electronics and communications engineering student.
# I consider myself a Linux enthusiast (I have been at peace ever since I migrated to Linux). Currently using Arch Linux with KDE and looking to use dwm instead soon.

As of late January 2024, I have claimed the GitHub education pack, and I'm looking to make as much use of it as possible. I would also like to take this as an oppurtunity to actually use GitHub more actively.
